Signature Verification App

AI-Powered Signature Verification Using CNN

Project Overview

This is a Signature Verification App that uses Deep Learning (Convolutional Neural Networks) to detect genuine vs forged signatures. Users can upload a signature image and instantly verify its authenticity with a confidence score.

The project demonstrates the use of AI, React.js, Flask, and cloud-based tools for a full-stack ML application.
